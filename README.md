# p5.js
This is a quick teach-myself demo of p5.js.
p5.js is a Javascript library with drawing functionality that allows you to use a browser page as a sketchpad. It can be used for art, data visualization, and websites alongside other tools like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

# Why p5.js?
I am a self-proclaimed artist and I consider styling of a webpage or application or product (or anything really) to be very important. If something isn't clean (or messy in a clean way), it decreases user trust in the application and can decrease the overall value of the product.

p5.js looks like a useful tool to create artsy user interfaces. 

# Download
Open up your local repository in your CLI and typed "npm install -s p5!
